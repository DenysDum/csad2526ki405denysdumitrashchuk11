1.
Prompt:
@workspace create a "Hello World" program in main.cpp

Answer:
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
•	Includes the <iostream> header for output.
•	Defines the main function as the program entry point.
•	Uses std::cout to print "Hello World" followed by a newline.
•	Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
This code is compatible with C++14 and can be compiled in Visual Studio 2022.

2.
Prompt:
@workspace create a CMakeLists.txt file to build main.cpp

Answer:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

project(HelloWorld LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_executable(HelloWorld main.cpp)

Explanation:
•	Sets the minimum required CMake version to 3.8 (suitable for C++14 and Visual Studio 2022).
•	Names the project HelloWorld and specifies C++ as the language.
•	Enforces the use of the C++14 standard.
•	Adds an executable target using main.cpp.
This configuration is ready for building your "Hello World" program.

3.
Prompt:
@workspace create a .gitignore file for a C++ project using Visual Studio

Answer:
#pragma once

inline int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

Explanation:
•	The function add takes two int parameters and returns their sum.
•	Marked as inline for potential performance improvement and to avoid multiple definition errors if included in multiple translation units.
•	The #pragma once directive ensures the header is included only once during compilation.


4. 
Prompt:
@workspace fill the unit_tests.cpp

Answer:
#include "math_operations.h"
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Test add function
    assert(add(2, 3) == 5);
    assert(add(-1, 1) == 0);
    assert(add(0, 0) == 0);
    assert(add(-5, -7) == -12);

    std::cout << "All unit tests passed." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

Explanation:
•	Includes math_operations.h for the add function.
•	Uses assert to verify correctness for several test cases.
•	Prints a success message if all tests pass.
•	Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
This is a simple, self-contained unit test for your add function, compatible with C++14 and Visual Studio 2022.

# Instructions for building and running tests
message(STATUS "To build the test executable, run: cmake --build . --target unit_tests")
message(STATUS "To launch all tests, run: ctest --output-on-failure")

Explanation:
•	Added message(STATUS "...") lines to provide clear instructions during CMake configuration.
•	These messages will appear in the CMake output, guiding you to build the test executable (unit_tests) and run all tests using ctest.
No changes to build logic; only user guidance was added.

7.
Prompt:
add the following to the ci.sh(for Linux/macOs) and ci.bat(Windows). Both scripts should automate the build process for a CMake project. The scripts must perform the following steps:
1.	Create a directory named build if it doesn't already exist.
2.	Change the current directory to build.
3.	Configure the project by running cmake ...
4.	Build the project by running cmake --build .. 5. Make sure to give access for the execution and apply changes 6. Run tests by executing ctest and show output only if tests fail.

Answer:
ci.sh (Linux/macOS)
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Step 1: Create build directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p build

# Step 2: Change to build directory
cd build

# Step 3: Configure the project
cmake ..

# Step 4: Build the project
cmake --build .

# Step 5: Ensure script is executable (applies to itself)
chmod +x ../ci.sh

# Step 6: Run tests, show output only if tests fail
ctest --output-on-failure

ci.bat (Windows)
@echo off
REM Step 1: Create build directory if it doesn't exist
if not exist build mkdir build

REM Step 2: Change to build directory
cd build

REM Step 3: Configure the project
cmake ..

REM Step 4: Build the project
cmake --build .

REM Step 5: No need to set executable permission on Windows

REM Step 6: Run tests, show output only if tests fail
ctest --output-on-failure

REM Return to previous directory
cd ..
Notes:
•	Both scripts create and enter the build directory, configure, build, and run tests.
•	The shell script (ci.sh) sets executable permission for itself.
•	The batch script (ci.bat) omits permission changes, as they're not needed on Windows.
•	ctest --output-on-failure displays output only for failed tests.

# Instructions for building and running
message(STATUS "To build the test executable, run: cmake --build . --target unit_tests")
message(STATUS "To launch all tests, run: ctest --output-on-failure")

Change made:
•	Updated the path to unit_tests.cpp to tests/unit_tests.cpp in the add_executable(unit_tests ...) command.
This ensures CMake can find your test source file in the correct directory.

9.
Prompt:
Add to the Cmakelists.txt a path to math_operations.h that located in the root folder of solution.

Answer:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)

message(STATUS "To build the test executable, run: cmake --build . --target unit_tests")
message(STATUS "To run all tests, execute: ctest --output-on-failure")

Change made:
•	Added target_include_directories(HelloWorld PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}) and the same for unit_tests to ensure the compiler can find math_operations.h in the root folder.
This guarantees both your main and test targets can include the header file without path issues.

message(STATUS "To build the test executable, run: cmake --build . --target unit_tests")
message(STATUS "To run all tests, execute: ctest --output-on-failure")

Change made:
•	Added add_test(NAME unit_tests COMMAND unit_tests) to explicitly register unit_tests as a test for CTest.
This ensures that running ctest will execute your test binary, even if you are not using GoogleTest macros.

11.
Prompt:
Add the defining of the debug config while using command ctest in ci.bat and ci.sh.

Answer:
#!/bin/bash

# Step 3: Configure the project
cmake ..

# Step 4: Build the project
cmake --build . --config Debug

# Step 5: Ensure script is executable (applies to itself)
chmod +x ../ci.sh

# Step 6: Run tests in Debug config, show output only if tests fail
ctest --output-on-failure -C Debug

@echo off
REM Step 1: Create build directory if it doesn't exist
if not exist build mkdir build

REM Step 2: Change to build directory
cd build

REM Step 3: Configure the project
cmake ..

REM Step 4: Build the project in Debug configuration
cmake --build . --config Debug

REM Step 5: No need to set executable permission on Windows

REM Step 6: Run tests in Debug config, show output only if tests fail
ctest --output-on-failure -C Debug

REM Return to previous directory
cd ..

Explanation:
•	Added --config Debug to both cmake --build and ctest commands to ensure the Debug configuration is used for building and testing.
•	This is important for multi-config generators (like Visual Studio) and ensures tests run against the Debug build.

12.
Prompt:
@workflow fill the ci.yml with a workflow that does the following: Trigger: Launch the workflow on push or pull request to branches containing "develop" or "master" in their name. Job: Create one Job (for example, cross_build). Strategy: Use a matrix (strategy: matrix) to run the build on three operating systems:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest (Linux) runs-on: windows-latest (Windows) runs-on: macos-latest (macOS)
Steps: Each build should include the following steps:
Checkout code (actions/checkout@v4) Install CMake (if needed) Run configuration and build commands (execute the script from Stage 3) Deploy

Answer:
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '*develop*'
      - '*master*'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '*develop*'

        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install CMake
        uses: jwlawson/actions-setup-cmake@v1
        with:
          cmake-version: '3.14.0' # Minimum for C++14, adjust as needed

      - name: Configure and Build
        run: |
          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
          cmake --build . --config Release

      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploy step goes here"

Explanation:
•	Triggers on push or pull request to branches containing "develop" or "master".
•	Uses a matrix to build on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.
•	Steps: checkout, install CMake, configure/build, and a placeholder deploy step.
•	The CMake install step uses a cross-platform action.
•	The build step uses standard CMake commands for all platforms.
•	The deploy step is a placeholder; replace with your actual deployment logic.
